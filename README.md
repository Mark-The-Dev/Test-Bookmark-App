# Bookmark App

This is a fun bookmark app that performs simple AJAX fetch calls for all states of CRUD. This Application not only interacts with the Thinkful API, it also tracks and displays that data in the application itself to allow editing of said database.

## User Stories completed

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
